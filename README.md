Homework3 for Andrew Wolf and Professor Panfilov

I got some issues with import of custome functions (nor sys, neither pyrhonpath helped me). I think, i require to deal with settings.json But i am not advanced in VS Code, so this is my goal for improvement

The repository consists of:

Folder "data" with data I use
Folder "model", which contains: folder "conf" - saved models with best scores and py-file "models_building" where i wrote functions for preprocessing, NB and SVM. Also there is svm_nb.py file in folder "model". I expected to write only functions for triggering defs from models_building.py but as it mentioned below I will also rewrite it.
